        <h3>Reports: </h3>
          <p><strong>Online reports available 24 hours a day 7 days a week from any computer, tablet or phone.</strong> Using our system, you can walk your facility with a phone, laptop or tablet and view devices and equipment while looking at them in your report or work order. This is useful when walking with an inspector or trying to find a deficiency. You can view your reports even when you are not onsite. They can be downloaded and printed or emailed to anyone you choose at anytime. We are also available at (303) 697-7377 to look up, download, email or print your reports for you. Your reports are safe and backed up on two servers in separate locations and accessible only by you using a  user login and password. You can view your fire alarm, fire sprinkler, extinguisher, kitchen hood, damper, door, backflow, smoke control, security reports and work orders at anytime. These reports are available to be downloaded in a document format for editing or email and can be printed. This system puts all of your reports in the same format and in the same place all of the time. There is no cost for this service if you hire the FireTest Company to test your equipment. If you want to test it yourself or have a preferred vendor, you can still use our system by subscribing to our service.
